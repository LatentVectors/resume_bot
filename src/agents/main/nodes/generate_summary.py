    Generate a professional summary grounded in the user's experience and free-form responses to career-related questions, targeted for a specific job description.

    This node creates a compelling professional summary that highlights the candidate's most relevant experience and skills as they relate to the target job. The summary is generated using an LLM that analyzes the job description, work experience, and additional responses to craft a personalized, impactful summary.

    Implementation Requirements:
    - Validate required inputs (job_description, experiences, responses) early
    - Use string parser for free-form text output
    - Format experience data appropriately for the prompt
    - Return only the professional_summary field in PartialInternalState
    - Handle LLM errors gracefully with retry logic
    - Log node execution for debugging

    Reads:
    - job_description: str - The target job description to tailor the summary for
    - experiences: list[Experience] - List of work experience objects
    - responses: str - Additional free-form responses about career goals/background

    Returns:
    - professional_summary: str - Generated professional summary text
