### Deletion Confirmations

Use confirmation dialogs before deleting significant objects that are difficult or impossible to undo. Confirmation dialogs should:

- Display the item name/title being deleted
- Clearly state the action cannot be undone
- Require explicit "Delete" or "Confirm" action
- Use destructive button styling (e.g., `variant="destructive"`)

**When confirmation is not necessary:**

- Deleting easily recoverable items
- Operations that can be easily undone
- Temporary or draft content with minimal user investment
