Convert the spec_draft document into a final draft in the spec.md file.

The spec acts as the comprehensive source of truth for this sprint and should include all the necessary context and technical details to implement this sprint. It should leave no ambiguity for important details necessary to properly implement the changes required.

The spec.md will act as a reference for an LLM coding agent responsible for completing this sprint.

The spec should include the following information if applicable:
- An overview of the changes implemented in this sprint.
- User stories for the new functionality, if applicable.
- An outline of any new data models proposed.
- An other technical details determined in the spec_draft or related conversations.
- Specific filepaths for files for any files that need to be added, edited, or deleted as part of this sprint.
- Specific files or modules relevant to this sprint.
- Details on how things should function such as a function, workflow, or other process.
- Describe what any new functions, services, ect. are supposed to do.
- Any reasoning or rationale behind decisions, preferences, or changes that provides context for the sprint and its changes.
- Any other information required to properly understand this sprint, the desired changes, the expected deliverables, or important technical details.

Strive to retain all the final decisions and implementation details provided in the spec_draft and related conversations. Cleaning and organizing these raw notes is desirable, but do not exclude or leave out information provided in the spec_draft if it is relevant to this sprint. If there is information in the spec_draft that is outdated and negated or revised by further direction in the draft or related conversation, you should leave that stale information out of the final spec.

The spec should have all the information a junior developer needs to complete this sprint. They should be able to independently find answers to any questions they have about this sprint and how to implement it in this document.
