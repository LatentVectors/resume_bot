# LangGraph Deploy Documentation Index

Quick reference guide for finding relevant documentation based on your implementation needs.
The following provides and overview of the contents of the langgraph_deploy directory. To understand a given topic deeper, read the related file for the full documentation of the given topic.

---

## Setup & Configuration

**project_structure_and_setup.md**: File structure requirements, `langgraph.json` basics, and monorepo support for deployable agents.
**langgraph_json_config.md**: Complete reference for all `langgraph.json` configuration options including dependencies, graphs, auth, store, and HTTP settings.
**langgraph_cli.md**: CLI commands (`dev`, `build`, `up`, `dockerfile`) with all options for local development and Docker deployments.
**ci_cd.md**: Defining deployable graphs, dependency management with `pyproject.toml`, and deployment via CLI.
**deploy_to_cloud.md**: Deploying graphs to LangSmith cloud via GitHub integration, automatic updates, and environment configuration.
**deployment_components.md**: Architecture overview: Control/Data Planes, Components, Agent Server, and how they interact.

---

## Core API & Client Interaction

**assistants.md**: Managing assistants (graph configurations), threads (persistent state), and runs. Core SDK methods for CRUD operations.
**runs.md**: Executing runs: stateless, stateful (on threads), background runs, cron jobs, and configurable headers for per-request config.
**streaming_api.md**: Streaming graph outputs with different modes (`updates`, `values`, `messages-tuple`, `debug`, `custom`, `events`).
**remote_graph.md**: Using `RemoteGraph` client for invoking deployed graphs, state management, authentication, and subgraph composition.

---

## Handling User Interactions

**double_texting.md**: Managing concurrent requests to the same thread with multitask strategies: `reject`, `enqueue`, `interrupt`, `rollback`.
**human_in_the_loop.md**: Pausing graph execution at specific nodes, providing human feedback, and resuming from checkpoints.
**time_travel.md**: Accessing checkpoint history, modifying past states, and resuming execution from any point to fork conversation paths.

---

## Frontend Integration

**react_use_stream.md**: React `useStream` hook for connecting to deployed graphs, managing messages, handling interrupts, and optimistic updates.
**generative_ui.md**: Backend and frontend setup for dynamic UI component generation, including `push_ui_message`, `LoadExternalComponent`, and local component maps.
**webhooks.md**: Setting up event-driven callbacks on run completion, securing webhooks with tokens, and disabling webhooks server-side.

---

## Authentication & Security

**auth_and_access_control.md**: Implementing `@auth.authenticate` handlers, resource-level authorization with `@auth.on`, and OpenAPI security schemas.

---

## Advanced Features

**semantic_search.md**: Configuring semantic search over persistent state with embedding models, custom embedders, and `BaseStore.search()` usage.
**mcp.md**: Model Context Protocol for exposing tools and resources to LLMs, including server setup and configuration.
**a2a.md**: Agent-to-Agent communication protocol for inter-agent messaging using JSON-RPC methods (`message/send`, `message/stream`).
**rebuilt_at_runtime.md**: Creating graph-making functions for per-run graph customization based on runtime configuration.

---

## Server Customization & Operations

**server_customization.md**: Adding custom FastAPI routes, middleware (pre/post-auth), and lifespan events for resource management.
**scaling.md**: Performance tuning: worker jobs, async patterns, durability settings, autoscaling, and self-hosted configuration examples.
**ttl.md**: Configuring Time-to-Live policies for automatic cleanup of checkpoints and store items in `langgraph.json`.
